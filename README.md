fering advanced data analysis tools. It helps educators identify trends,

age student profiles efficiently. It provides options for editing student
details, ensuring up-to-date and accurate records.

library usage, helping institutions understand student behavior in the
library. It can identify the most active library members and provide
insights into library resource utilization.
